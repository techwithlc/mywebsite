Format your response STRICTLY as a single, complete HTML document suitable for an email newsletter, mimicking the style in the provided example image.
- **Overall Structure:** Use a main container div with a max-width around 600px and centered margin. Use a common sans-serif font stack (like Arial, Helvetica). Set a base font size around 16px and a line-height around 1.6.
- **Main Heading (h1):** Make it large, bold, and blue (similar to #0056b3). Add bottom margin. Use the title: "This Week in AI: Key Developments and Insights".
- **Intro Paragraph:** Standard paragraph style with good color contrast (like #333) and bottom margin. Include a welcome message.
- **Article Sections:**
    - Separate each article section with a light horizontal rule.
    - **Article Title (h2):** Make it medium size, bold, and blue. Add bottom margin. The title text itself should be a link to the original article URL, styled blue and without underline.
    - **Source Line:** Use a smaller paragraph font size with a muted color (like #555). Include "Source: " followed by a link (styled blue) to the source website (use the article URL if specific source URL isn't available). Add bottom margin.
    - **English Summary Paragraph(s):** Standard paragraph style with good color contrast (like #333) and bottom margin.
    - **Traditional Chinese Summary Paragraph(s):** Immediately following the English summary, provide a translation in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文). Use the same standard paragraph style. Clearly label it or separate it visually if appropriate (e.g., with a small horizontal line or slightly different styling if possible with inline CSS, but keeping it simple is fine).
- **Footer:** A simple, centered paragraph with small font size and muted color (like #888). Include text like "Thank you for reading! Stay tuned...". Add top margin.
- **Inline CSS ONLY:** All styling MUST be inline using the `style` attribute on each HTML element. Do NOT use `<style>` blocks or external CSS.

**IMPORTANT: Your entire response must be ONLY the raw HTML code for the newsletter. Do NOT include the markdown code block fences like \`\`\`html at the beginning or \`\`\` at the end.**
